# Choir Pitch Accuracy Detector

This project generates synthetic vocal audio data with controlled pitch deviations
to train a machine learning model that classifies pitch accuracy as in-tune,
slightly off, or off-pitch.

## Current Stage
- Synthetic data generation using Python
- Automatic labeling of pitch accuracy classes

## Future Work
- Feature extraction (pitch, MFCC)
- ML model training
- Real-time feedback interface
